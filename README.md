exploration of hockey  ata dictated by the whims of a hockey fan 

This respository is an explorative look at hockey data from the 2005-06 season to the 2016-17 season. I specifically chose to start with 2005, as I personally feel like that was the beginning of the "modern" era of hockey as we know it now in 2022. I ended with 2017, since that endpoint provides 10 full seasons of data (as 2012-13 was a lockout shortened season). 

Initally, this was intended to be an upload of a college data project, but I lost those files, and upon recalling the steps I chose... well, let's just say that hindsight is 20/20. I chose a individual-focused approach then, but now, after considering the fact that hockey is one of the most collaborative sports that exists, I have chosen a team-based approach. In the game of hockey, one star is rarely enough to lift entire teams the way they might in basketball, and there is significantly less data (both individual and team) available than in baseball or football. Considering that, I chose an approach that would allow me to test (in a very limited sense) whether there was any correlation between specific team compositions and their success in any given season. 

Thank you for looking over my (ever-changing) hockey rambles!
